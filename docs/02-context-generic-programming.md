# Context-Generic Programming

This section covers the technical background needed for understanding the programming
techniques used by the relayer framework. Readers with backgrounds in
dynamically-typed programming languages such as JavaScript or Python may find
the techniques used here to be similar to dynamic typing, but with static type guarantees.

We will start with simple examples and then slowly relate them to the design
of the relayer framework.
